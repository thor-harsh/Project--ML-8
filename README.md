# Project--ML-8


<table>

**In this project we will build the model K Nearest Neighbor for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or K-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**

**So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!
